This project is using the p5.js library. 



### Try it out

All you need to run this project on your computer is git and an IDE of your choice that can run javascript on. I used Visual Studio Code.

To clone this project, what I did first was create a folder on my machine where I wanted to download the project to. Then, copy the directoy of the folder that you just created. 
Open a terminal and "cd" into the folder. Then follow the steps below:

```sh

And that is it!
